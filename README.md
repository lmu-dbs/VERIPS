# Batch Active learning by Diverse Gradient Embeddings (BADGE)
An implementation of the BADGE batch active learning algorithm. Details are provided in our article, 
[Deep Batch Active Learning by Diverse, Uncertain Gradient Lower Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03671), which will appear as a talk in ICLR 2020.
This code was built by modifying [Kuan-Hao Huang's deep active learning repository](https://github.com/ej0cl6/deep-active-learning).

# Dependencies

To run this code fully, you'll need [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (we're using version 1.4.0), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and [OpenML](https://github.com/openml/openml-python).
We've been running our code in Python 3.7.

# Running an experiment

`python run.py --model resnet --nQuery 1000 --data CIFAR10 --alg badge`\
runs an active learning experiment using a ResNet and CIFAR-10 data, querying batches of 1,000 samples according to the BADGE algorithm.
This code allows you to also run each of the baseline algorithms used in our paper. 

`python run.py --model mlp --nQuery 10000 --did 6 --alg conf`\
runs an active learning experiment using an MLP and dataset number 6 from OpenML, querying batches of 10,000 with confidence sampling.
Note that in our code, OpenML datasets can only be used with MLP architectures.
